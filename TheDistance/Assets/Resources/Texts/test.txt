START::Fragment I 

I don’t know much about being a real adult, but these past couples of weeks have made me feel like a real grown up. Natalie’s off jet setting in different countries. My novel is finally nearing completion. We’re even thinking about playing an online game together since her infamous rage quit a couple years back. Man, I miss her.

START::Fragment II 
Is it weird that Natalie didn’t read my novel? Is this her way of getting back at me for not going to her exhibit? If that’s it, then sure, I guess I understand. I mean I would have had to get on a plane and fly to her, and she only had to open an email, but okay, I understand. Jeepers… she’s been so flakey lately. Why did we wind up like this?

START::Fragment III
I still don’t really understand this whole being an adult gig, but these past couple of years have really made me feel older-ish. Sure, the book didn’t sell all that great, and things with Natalie sort of flatlined, but that just means I have some free time on my hands and an expensive pile of paperweights at my disposal. I wonder if she ever got a copy of my novel.
