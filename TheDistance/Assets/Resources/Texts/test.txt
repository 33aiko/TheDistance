START::LoveStory Lyric
We were both young when I first saw you
当我第一次看见你的时候，我们都还年轻
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
我闭上眼睛，一幕幕往事又在脑海中重现
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
我站在阳台上，空气里，浓浓的，是夏天的味道
END::LoveStory Lyric

People recognize me when I go to galleries now, whether my work is showing or not. I¡¯ve finally gotten back into gaming and holy crap, it¡¯s so much better than I remember! I¡¯m living my wildest dreams, and honestly, it¡¯s crazy to think that I¡¯m here. It¡¯s been a long road, and I¡¯m proud to say that I wouldn¡¯t change a thing. Well, maybe one thing...

I still don’t really understand this whole being an adult gig, but these past couple of years have really made me feel older-ish. Sure, the book didn’t sell all that great, and things with Natalie sort of flatlined, but that just means I have some free time on my hands and an expensive pile of paperweights at my disposal. I wonder if she ever got a copy of my novel.
